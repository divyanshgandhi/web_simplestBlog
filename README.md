# Sample for the series 'web'

This is the simplest, most basic blog you'll ever see. Consisting of a singe file only with inline styling, this represents the building block of any blog. Made this while getting started with Web Dev. Can be further styled with external CSS stylesheets and then made fucntional using JavaScript.
